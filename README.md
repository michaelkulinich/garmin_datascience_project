# Smartwatch Data Science Project
In this part of the project, we will be analyzing new data sets from Garmin watches. I have had the watch since July and have gone on about 35 runs; therefore, there are not enought data points to analyze only my running. However, I use the watch to track all of my other workouts. The first dataset tracks all of my activities statistics. For the next data set, we will be analyzing many health statistics. Since I wear my watch almost 24/7 for the last 6 months, it has tracked many various health statistics.
## Questions
Using the data collected from my smartwatch, I answered these three questions.
### 1) Is stress level higher on days when you donâ€™t exercise compared to if you do exercise?
### 2) What has the largest effect on stress, what is the best way to reduce stress, and how well can you predict stress from the other variables in the dataset?
### 3) How can the activities be clustered and what are the characteristics of each cluster?
